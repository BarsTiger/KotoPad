## ‚ùó Need to know

There are two play methods and each of them has pros and cons depending on what type of sound you are trying to play.

Direct stream method is default and preferred if playing files from YouTube, Spotify URL or long files from your hard drive. It CAN cut last second of audio but doesn't need long time to load file first time.

Download and convert method can cause long first load time and app crashes when playing sound at first time, but it doesn't cut last second of audio. Use it when you are trying to play short files from your hard drive.
